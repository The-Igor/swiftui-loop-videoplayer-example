# Load configurations from YAML file
# Youâ€™ll need a way to read and parse the YAML file from your script. While bash itself does not support parsing YAML natively, you can use a command-line tool like yq (a lightweight and portable command-line YAML processor).
# brew install yq

# Before you can run the script, you need to make it executable:
# chmod +x run_tests.sh

# Now, you can run your script from the command line:
# ./run_tests.sh
